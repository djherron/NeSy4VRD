# NeSy4VRD: Distributed Annotation Enhancement

A valuable feature of the **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** is that it enables a new **model of collaboration** for **dataset creation and enhancement**. This model embraces and combines the concepts of *continuous improvement* and of *distributed, independent, incremental enhancement*.  The name we have adopted for this new dataset creation and enhancement collaboration model is **Distributed Annotation Enhancement** (**DAE**).

## Distributed Annotation Enhancement: overview

The **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** enables the **DAE** model of collaboration by virtue of the fact that it facilitates all of the following activites:
1. **undertaking** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects;
2. **sharing** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects;
3. **reusing** individual NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects undertaken and shared by other researchers;
4. **composing** multiple NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects shared by other researchers in order to create unique, enriched datasets that combine the enhancements of diverse customisation projects. 

A researcher might typically initially **undertake** a NeSy4VRD annotation customisation project for personal and private reasons: e.g. to advance their particular research interests. But having **undertaken** such a project, a researcher might come to feel that their annotation customisations may have value for others and opt to **share** the project. This gives other researchers the option to **reuse** the shared project, by itself, in their own research.  Further, it also gives other researchers the option to **reuse** the annotation customisation project simultaneously with other shared projects, by **composing** (or combining) several of them to create a unique, consolidated set of NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotations that aggregates the annotation enhancements of multiple, independent customisation projects.

The details around **undertaking** NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotation customisation projects using the **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** are documented extensively throughout this `extensibility` folder and its `analysis`, `protocol`, and `workflow` subfolders.

For details of the **Distributed Annotation Enhancement** model of collaboration concerning **sharing**, **reusing** and **composing** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects, please see the following companion README files here in the `extensibility` folder:
