# NeSy4VRD: Distributed Annotation Enhancement

The **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** enables a **new model of collaboration** around dataset creation, sculpting and enhancement. The name we have adopted for this collaboration model is **Distributed Annotation Enhancement**, or **DAE**.

## Distributed Annotation Enhancement: overview

The key feature of the **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** that enables the **DAE** model of collaboration is that it simultaneously supports all of the following activites:
1. **undertaking** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects
2. **sharing** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects
3. **reusing** other people's NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects
4. **composing** diverse NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects.

One might well initially **undertake** a NeSy4VRD annotation customisation project for personal and private reasons: e.g. to advance one's personal research vision. But having **undertaken** such a project, a researcher might come to feel that their project has value generally and opt to **share** the project. This gives other researchers the option to **reuse** the project for their own research and, potentially, to **compose** the project along with others to create a unique instance of the NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotations that combines the features and enhancements of diverse annotation customisation projects. 

The details around using the **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** to **undertake** a NeSy4VRD annotation customisation project are documented extensively throughout the `extensibility` folder (and its subfolders) of the NeSy4VRD repository here on GitHub.

For details around **sharing**, **reusing** and **composing** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation projects, please see the following companion README files here in the `extensibility` folder:
