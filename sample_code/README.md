# NeSy4VRD: sample_code

This folder contain NeSy4VRD sample code that some may find helpful in getting to know NeSy4VRD and how to work with and manipulate the NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotations in conjunction with the companion NeSy4VRD OWL ontology, VRD-World, knowledge graphs and OWL reasoners. 

## load_and_augment.py

This script demonstrates the conversion of NeSy4VRD visual relationship (VR) annotations into RDF triples, loading them into a knowledge graph, extracting VR-related triples from a knowledge graph, and converting them back into native NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotation format. It also demonstrates the loading of the NeSy4VRD OWL ontology, VRD-World, into the knowledge graph and the materialisation of the knowledge graph using OWLRL.
