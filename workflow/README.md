# NeSy4VRD: workflow

This folder contains assets relating to the **NeSy4VRD workflow** component of the NeSy4VRD infrastructure that supports extensibility of the NeSy4VRD visual relationship annotations and, thereby, of the NeSy4VRD OWL ontology, VRD-World. The **NeSy4VRD workflow** component of the NeSy4VRD infrastructure supporting extensibility is a set of Python scripts and modules that together represent and implement a configurable, managed, automated and repeatable process for safely defining and applying large volumes of visual relationship annotation customisations for the VRD images that are available as part of the NeSy4VRD dataset.
