# VRD annotation customisation instructions file

# Step 7 of the annotations customisation process: remove the (key/value)
# entries from the VRD annotations dictionary for named images that have
# been found to be problematic (for some reason) and not worth fixing.

# The annotation customisation instruction to request removal of an image
# name's entry from the annotations dictionary is 'rimxxx' (for 'remove image').
# This instruction, 'rimxxx', MUST be present as the 3rd component of the
# image name line signalled by 'imname'. The removal will not be effected unless
# the 'rimxxx' instruction is explicitly specified along with the image name.

# example:
#
# imname; 8374215031_063bfdfa0c_b.jpg; rimxxx

# classes is 'grass'; so there's nothing to work with here! the image does
# not belong in the VRD dataset unless we introduce the object class 'zebra'

# 2D something that even I struggle to infer is in fact a box; there's too
# little to work with in this image, so it can't be rescued
