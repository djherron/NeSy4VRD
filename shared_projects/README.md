# NeSy4VRD: Shared Projects

The purpose of this `shared_projects` folder of the NeSy4VRD repository on GitHub is to act as a **central repository** for facilitating the **sharing**, **reusing** and **composing** of NeSy4VRD annotation customisation/enhancement projects **undertaken** by independent AI researchers.

The **NeSy4VRD extensibility support infrastructure** enables a new model of collaborative data annotation that we call **Distributed Annotation Enhancement** (**DAE**). For full information on the **DAE** model, see the several README files in the `extensibility` folder of this NeSy4VRD GitHub repo.  For the **DAE** model to function optimally, it needs to be **easy to share** and **easy to find** NeSy4VRD annotation customisation/enhancement projects. This `shared_projects` folder is a logical and recommended **central repository** for achieving those dual objectives.

## Using this central repository

AI researchers who have **undertaken** a NeSy4VRD annotation customisation/enhancement project and wish to share it with the wider AI research community can use this **central repository** for any of the following purposes:
* advertising and describing their shared NeSy4VRD project;
* hosting the archive `.zip` file of their shared NeSy4VRD project so others can download it directly from here, either for **reuse** in isolation, or for **composing** with other shared NeSy4VRD projects;
* *hyperlinking* to another location where the archive `.zip` file of their shared NeSy4VRD project can be accessed. 

AI researchers who opt to use this **central repository** for one or more of the purposes just described are invited to:
1. fork the NeSy4VRD repo;
2. add an entry to this README that advertises and *briefly* describes their NeSy4VRD annotation customisation/enhancement project;
3. optionally, add a *hyperlink* to their README entry to the location where the archive `.zip` file of their shared NeSy4VRD project can be accessed;
4. optionally, create a subfolder for hosting the archive `.zip` file of their shared NeSy4VRD project here on GitHub;
5. submit a GitHub **pull request** to have their amendments to this `shared_projects` **central repository** incorporated on GitHub.
